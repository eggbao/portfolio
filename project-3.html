                  <p class="paragraph-2">I worked in a team with Archivo De Resputas Emergencias De Puerto Rico (AREPR). They are a digital repository that depicts and describes the innovative knowledge production of grassroots community organizations in Puerto Rico in the wake of both natural and man-made disasters. They wanted a full-scale redesign of their site homepage, style guide, and social media strategy.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-2">With my team members, we needed to work together in order to present all of these deliverables to the client, AREPR. We used Figma in order to create the redesign of their website, and the style guide. We also used Figma to make a pdf that explained the basics of the social media strategy that we created. I helped research, design the website and style guide, and did a little bit of help figuring out the social media strategy.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">First things first, my team and I focused on creating the style guide so that we would have a basic structure when building the mockup of the website. We wanted to focus on accessibility and readability for this website. So, when we took a look at colors, we wanted to find a color pallet that would look good to somebody with color blindness. When we did a little bit of research online, most websites said that the best color pallet to use for someone with color blindness is orange and blue. Since those colors were already pretty similar to the one on the original homepage, we decided to go ahead and use orange and blue. Also, the colors are pretty similar to the Puerto Rican flag colors, which was good because this site is about Puerto Rico. We made sure the colors were not too harsh either. <br><br>Next, Â we decided to use Open Sans as the only typeface used on the site, because it is easily readable in all styles and weights, clean, and is web safe. We decided to go with extra bold, semi-bold, and regular weights on the website in order to show hierarchy of importance.<br><br>The biggest change that we did was the logo. The original logo was just &quot;AREPR&quot; over a black and white outline of Puerto Rico. While it looked okay, it did not match the website, and it did not scale well. When shown in smaller sizes it was difficult to read. So, we decided to go for something a little bit different and put the word &quot;we&quot; in front of AREPR. So, the logo would read WE AREPR. We also put a space between AREPR so that it would read as &quot;We are Puerto Rico&quot; which gives more sense of community. This text was to be shown on top of either a blue, orange, black, or white circle in order to match the modern theme that the website gives off.<br></p>

                </div>
                <p class="paragraph-2">For the social media strategy, my team and I first took a deep look into what current social media sites AREPR were using and how they were using it. It turned out that AREPR had very little social media presence. They were using Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. However, the number of posts that they had on here were very little and did little to showcase what the actual goal of the organization was. We decided to keep using Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. However, the amount of content on all of these platforms should change.<br><br>A key goal for our social media strategy is to raise awareness of the work that AREPR was doing. So, in order to change this, we needed these platforms to respond to engagement at least once a day and post a lot more often. Seeing that this is a digital repository, their target audience is scholars. Their social media needs to build a collection of merit that draws scholars from all walks of life to access information from their archive. However, they should not limit themselves to just scholars. The ultimate goal is to make this a digital library a source of information for anyone around the world who is interested.<br><br>Since Facebook is by far the most used social media platform around the world, we believed that it will be a crucial element to this organization. Since they already have a big following on this platform, they should use that account to spread information on upcoming important dates. This account should be updated every few days at the minimum. <br><br>Instagram is one of the best platforms for media sharing, which will make this a perfect channel for sharing new additions to their digital archive. This will be a vital tool in helping to bring the much-needed attention to their organization. This account should be updated any time exciting additions come into their repository.<br><br>Lastly, Twitter will also play a huge role in the growth of their organization because of its ability to keep them connected to what is happening in the world every day. It has become a great platform of spreading information so they should utilize it more often. We plan on having them use Twitter to help spread information about the happenings of Puerto Rico and how it effects their organization.<br></p>
