                  <p class="paragraph-2">As part of a summer internship, I worked remotely with Elk Electronics, located in Dublin, Ireland. They are a startup company that produces at-home electric vehicle chargers called the Elk Box. They were looking for a design of their mobile app, redesign of their website, and production of branded document templates, while I was a part of their team.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">While working with a developer and the co-founder of the company, I used Figma, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign in order to first produce a style guide for Elk Electronics. Using that style guide, I collaborated with my team to create document templates, a freshly redesigned and updated website, and lastly a design for their mobile app.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">For this case study, I will focus on the creation process of the mobile application. Due to this being a summer internship, and having worked on other things for this role during the first 1.5 to 2 months here, I only had about a month to produce a final design for the app. <br><br>First, I communicated and brainstormed with my team on what their vision was for the app and how exactly it the user would interact with it, as I initially did not know much about electric vehicles (EVs). In addition to this, I also did my own research on competitor EV charger apps, to give me some inspiration and see how I could create something that stands out, but still sticks to that common design standards that are used in other apps, thus not confusing the user. This brainstorming session allowed me to have a good sense of what the user flow would look like. <br><br>Unfortunately, I do not have a photo of the mobile user flow, however, below is a user flow I created for the user side of the desktop website, which is highly similar.<br></p>

                  <div class="text-block-3 caption2 caption3">User flow for the desktop website</div>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">In addition, the initial brainstorming session and user flow allowed me to understand what kind of pages would be on the app, and how an average user might go through and use the app.<br><br>The main pages included:<br></p>
                  <ul role="list" class="list">
                    <li class="list-item">Login / create account</li>
                    <li class="list-item-2">Home / start charge </li>
                    <li class="list-item-3">Schedule charge</li>
                    <li class="list-item-4">Charging statistics</li>
                    <li>Charger map</li>
                    <li>Account settings</li>
                    <li>Payment settings</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">After brainstorming, I presented some low fidelity sketches of the layout of the app to my team. From their feedback, I was able to create some medium fidelity wireframes to show the basic layout of the whole app. <br><br>One big change in particular that had to be made when going from the low fidelity sketches to the medium fidelity wireframes was the style of the start charge / home page. At first, I provided some sketches of a circle with the battery percentage inside of it, as well as a different version using a rectangle as a battery percentage bar instead. However, after meeting with my team, I learned that it was not possible to provide an accurate battery percentage number during charging. So, I decided to create a simple &quot;Start Charge&quot; button that would change to &quot;Stop Charge&quot; when pressed and while the vehicle was actively charging. I wanted to keep the button large and in the middle of the page, so that it would be easy for users to access and check to see if their vehicle was still charging. <br><br>Unfortunately, I also do not have any screenshots or photos of this process because the Figma file was edited to create the final high fidelity wireframe and prototype.<br></p>

                  <p class="paragraph-2">Using the style guide and continuous communication with my team, we were able to fill in the wireframe with colors, fonts, text, and other styling in order to create a high fidelity prototype of the app. <br><br>We wanted to keep the gradient from the logo as a signature style of the brand, while also making sure we adhered to accessibility guidelines such as color/text contrast and usability. In addition, we wanted to create a sleek look and feel to the app, to show that the brand was eye-catching, engaging, and up to date with modern application design trends. This sleek look also allows for the user to quickly find information in the app and makes the text easy to read.<br></p>

                  <p class="paragraph-2">Lastly, after all of the pages were created, I was given a list of pop-ups to create throughout the app that would alert the user of anything that was important. <br><br>These pop-ups included:<br></p>
                  <ul role="list" class="list">
                    <li class="list-item">Charger booked</li>
                    <li class="list-item-2">Charge complete</li>
                    <li class="list-item-3">Extended warranty available</li>
                    <li class="list-item-4">Fault detected</li>
                    <li>Password updated</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">In the photo above, there is a photo of what the &quot;Password Updated&quot; pop-up looked like, which was similar to all of the other icons we created. We wanted to have a different large, flat icon to go with each pop-up, which added a visual element of interest to the viewer. While looking for icons, I made sure they were all copyright free and had the correct licensing that we could use and edit using Adobe Photoshop. In addition to icons, we wanted the design to pop out visually, but stay consistent with the rest of app. So, we used the blue gradient from the style guide and darkened the background, enhancing the visual contrast. Furthermore, we added a separate exit button at the bottom of each pop-up, so users would be able to clearly figure out how to close the pop-up, enhancing usability and accessibility.<br><br>At the end of the design process, the final prototype of all pages and pop-ups, as well as a Google Drive folder that included all the files of the visual elements in the prototype, were emailed to my team so they could show the design to other members of Elk Electronics and start the app development process.<br></p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="paragraph-2">Throughout this design process, I learned a lot because this was my first time working as a designer for a company, instead of working on a class or personal project. <br><br>For instance, I learned a lot about how to work with the founders of a company and developers, both of which helped me keep in mind the limitations of what the Elk Box can do, as well as the limitations of what we could produce in terms of software application development. The continuous communication between these team members and myself also allowed me to hone my teamworking and communication skills, as well as produce a great design for the app that is accessible, easy to use, and sleek. Even though we did not have time to do any user research before designing, I think we did a great job in using all the resources we had to produce a quality and intuitive design.<br><br>I am very greatful for this experience and for this to have been my first internship! I worked with an amazing team of people throughout this entire design process, and they have definitely helped me become more confident in my abilities as a designer.<br></p>
