            <p class="no-margin paragraph-s">The Longevity Project is a collective working in response to the anti-aging drug industry and it&#x27;s effect on the growing lifespan gap between the wealthy and lower class. <br><br>Many people are unable to afford anti-aging drugs, also known as senolytics, resulting in a lack of access to medical care for many elderly, and a large gap between the lifespan of social classes. <br><br>We are focused on helping those who do not have access to these drugs through giving safe, affordable, and medically tested DIY solutions for creating your own senolytics at home.</p>

        <h1 class="no-margin sizing">What&#x27;s the Problem?</h1>
        <p class="no-margin paragraph-s">As you grow older, more and more of your body&#x27;s cells turn senescent, meaning they cannot divide but do not die off. Senescent cells cause a majority of age-related health issues because the reduce body tissue repair, raises the risk of cancer and alzheimer&#x27;s, increases chronic inflammation. When cells turn senescent, they also encourange surrounding cells to become scenescent, which quickly increases the chance of encountering these issues. <br><br>However, senolytics are anti-aging drugs that can dramatically decrease the number of senescent cells in the body. This makes it a huge preventative for age-related health problems. In addition, the continued use of senolytics increases lifespan up to 30%. <br>‍<br>In the past few decades, the popularity and research of senolytics and other anti-aging drugs has increased dramatically. Since it&#x27;s early development stages in the 2020&#x27;s, billionares and the ultra wealthy have invested billions of dollars in it because they have high interest in it. This includes politicians, CEO&#x27;s, and big names in the tech industry. <br><br>Because these drugs are sold at very high costs, only wealthy people are able to afford them, especially those in power. As a result, those in power and the upper class are the only ones that are able to readily access them, have healthy elderly lives, and live longer that those who are lower class. This has created a widening age gap between social classes, which becomes more apparent and stark with the diminishing middle class.<br>‍<br>At The Longevity Project, we believe that everyone should have access to medical treatment and preventative. The widening age gap and lack of medical access is continuning to hurt lower class communities around the world by increasing class struggle and power. We believe everyone should have an equal chance at living and longevity.<br></p>
